At a first we have to run the "npm install" command in terminal(of course in source code path) to install node modules.
And you can run "npm run start" command to run the script.
And also you can run "npm run package" command to build app for mac OS or windows version.

(If you run the app(run built app or run app using the npm start), then all configuration(related with syncthing) will be set automatically)
After run the electron app you can paste the API key and input rest api url,
and next pressing the fetch data button, you can get the result.
